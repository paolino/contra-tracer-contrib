Provides a combinator for intercepting trace events and selectively
forwarding them to a secondary tracer based on a partial mapping function.

{- | Modify a 'Tracer' to emit to another 'Tracer' based on a partial mapping
function.

The intercepted tracer continues to emit all events to the primary tracer,
but also forwards events to a secondary tracer when the mapping function
returns 'Just'.

@
intercept secondary mapping primary
@

* @secondary@ - receives transformed events when mapping succeeds
* @mapping@ - partial function to transform events
* @primary@ - receives all events unchanged
